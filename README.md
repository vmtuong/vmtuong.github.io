- Effective communicator and mentor: understanding complex scientific concepts and making them assessable to audiences of various backgrounds; organising software tutorials at conferences; mentoring postdocs and postgraduate students.

# Work experience

## Senior Research Associate @ The Alan Turing Institute	(2021 - Present)
- Develop data-rich and theoretically grounded models of the socio-economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and other types of shocks for 'Shocks and Resilience' research project and 'Computational Social Science' research group.
  - Design, implement, and calibrate agent-based models of endogenous production in Python (vectorization with NumPy). This is the first model of its kind in which production networks emerge from realistic firm learning behaviour.
  - Train Gaussian Process Regressor to quantify the degree of sophistication of production and to provide the first large-scale measurements of technological sophistication across industries around the world.
- Guide a research assistant (a PhD student) to explore agent-based modelling for international trade and coach him on debugging, testing, and good coding practices.
- Published a paper and presented at IC2S2 (International Conference on Computational Social Science).

## Honorary Research Fellow @ University of Sheffield (2021 - Present)
- Continue dissemination of CASCADE project: Published 1 journal article (JASSS) and 2 conference papers (SSC, AI4ABM @ ICML). These are pioneering works in the nascent field 'Inverse Generative Social Science'.

## Research Associate @ University of Sheffield (2017 - 2021)
- Developed agent-based public-health-policy models for the international, interdisciplinary project CASCADE (Calibrated Agent Simulations for Combined Analysis of Drinking Etiologies), funded by the US National Institutes of Health (2.3 million USD, 5 years, 4 research centres, 3 countries).
  - Led the CASCADE’s ‘model discovery’ work package that applies Genetic Programming to seek novel combinations of social theories to better explain alcohol use patterns. This is pivotal in the nascent field of ‘Inverse Generative Social Science’, working with ABM pioneer – Joshua Epstein.
  - Designed a common architecture for with UML diagrams and Mediator design pattern.
  - Developed open-source simulation models in RepastHPC (C++) in collaboration with 3 other research associates using git version control and agile project management (Scrum).
  - Developed R scripts to calibrate models to empirical data and perform simulation experiments.
- Published 5 peer-reviewed journal articles, 3 conference papers, and 1 software review.
- Organised 2 conference tutorials to introduce CASCADE’s software framework to a mixed audience of social scientists and simulation practitioners (3 hours, 50 participants).
- Taught 3 modules: Agent-based modelling and multi-agent systems, Introduction to research methods, Dissertation - Master degree.
- Supervised 3 Master students (resulting in 1 journal article).
- Mentored 6 PhD students in Thesis Mentoring Programme (2 dedicated outstanding mentor awards).

## Teaching Assistant @ University of Nottingham (2013 - 2016)
- Supported BSc and MSc students in the computer labs for 4 modules: Simulation for Decision Support, Software Application Development, Object-Oriented Systems, Database Systems.

## IT Consultant @ University of Nottingham and Accenture (2011 - 2012)
- Consulted, designed, and deployed a new membership database in Microsoft Access for a local charity.

# Education

## PhD Computer Science, University of Nottingham (2013 – 2017)
- Thesis title: A Software Engineering Approach for Agent-Based Modelling of Public Goods Games.
- Developed a framework to provide a structured approach to the development process of agent-based social simulations, applied to discrete and continuous time Public Goods Games.

## MSc Management of Information Technology (Distinction), University of Nottingham (2011 – 2012)
- Dissertation title: Comparison study of human behaviour simulation.
- Compared a probabilistic approach and a fuzzy logic approach for representing human behaviour in a model of energy consumption in a shared office.

## BSc Hons Computer Science (First Class), University of Nottingham	(2009 – 2011)
- Dissertation title: Learning to segment scanning electron microscope images.
- Applied Support Vector Machine to segment cell wall from electron microscope images.
